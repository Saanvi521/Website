This website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript explores Indian culture and was presented to the audience at my high school. There is a homepage with headers and link 
that direct to the other categories within Indian culture such as: tourism, food/clothing, languages, and religion. This was my first CS project in high school which 
allowed me to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the first time and understand how front-end development works.
